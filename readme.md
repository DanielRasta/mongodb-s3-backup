# Mongodb to Amazon s3 Backup Script

#### this is an improvement of the [original](https://github.com/RGBboy/mongodb-s3-backup) RGBoy script.

## Requirements

* Running mongod process
* mongodump
* mongo (**Lower then 3.0** - this script uses `eval`)
* openssl
* tar
* rm
* curl (using port 443 for https)

###Access Control

If authorization is enabled, you must have access to all actions on all resources in order to run eval. Providing such access is not recommended, but if your organization requires a user to run eval, create a role that grants anyAction on anyResource. Do not assign this role to any other user.


## Usage

`bash /path/to/backup.sh -u MONGODB_USER -p MONGODB_PASSWORD -k AWS_ACCESS_KEY -s AWS_SECRET_KEY -r S3_REGION -b S3_BUCKET [-P MONGODB_PORT]`

Where `S3_REGION` is in the format `ap-southeast-1`

And port is optional while the default value is 27017.

## Cron

### Daily

Add the following line to `/etc/cron.d/db-backup` to run the script every day at midnight (UTC time) 

    0 0 * * * root /bin/bash /path/to/backup.sh -u MONGODB_USER -p MONGODB_PASSWORD -k AWS_ACCESS_KEY -s AWS_SECRET_KEY -b S3_BUCKET [-P MONGODB_PORT]
